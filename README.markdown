# range - by Robert Massaioli

The range library is written in Haskell and it's purpose is to make it easy to deal with
ranges. For example you may have the following ranges:

    1-4, 6-23, 15-50, 90-

And you are given a value x, how do you know if the value x is in those ranges? That is
the question that this library answers. You just load your ranges using the library and then
you can query to see if values exist inside your ranges. This library aims to be as
efficient as light as possible while still being useful.

## Example Code

TODO run through a very simple example of using the codebase.

## Installation Instructions

TODO Please explain how to install the library (It will be on hackage soon)
